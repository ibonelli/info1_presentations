conio.h is a C header file used in old MS-DOS compilers to create text user interfaces. Compilers that targeted non-DOS operating systems, such as Linux, Win32 and OS/2, provided different implementations of these functions.

The #include <curses.h> will give you almost all the functionalities that was provided in conio.h

The original conio.h was implemented by Borland, so its not a part of the C Standard Library nor is defined by POSIX.

But here is an implementation for Linux that uses ncurses to do the job:

A popular Linux library which has similar functionality would be ncurses:
