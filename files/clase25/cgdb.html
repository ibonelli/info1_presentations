<h2 class="unnumbered">Summary of CGDB</h2>

<p>CGDB is a curses-based interface to the GNU Debugger (GDB).  The goal of CGDB
is to be lightweight and responsive; not encumbered with unnecessary features.

   </p><p>The interface is designed to deliver the familiar GDB text interface, with a
split screen showing the source as it executes.  The UI is modeled on the
classic Unix text editor, vi.  Those familiar with vi should feel right at
home using CGDB.

   </p><p>The library responsible for communicating with GDB is called Trivial GDB
(tgdb, or more accurately, libtgdb).  This abstraction allows the UI code to
be independent of the debugger, as well as greatly simplifying its
implementation.

   </p><p>Those wanting to develop other interfaces to GDB are welcome to use libtgdb
as the basis for their program.  Many of the headaches of parsing GDB's output
and annotations can be avoided by using it.

   </p><p>Some features offered by CGDB are:

     </p><ul>
<li>Syntax-highlighted source window

     </li><li>Visual breakpoint setting

     </li><li>Keyboard shortcuts for common functions

     </li><li>Searching source window (using regexp)
</li></ul>

<h2 class="chapter">1 Getting In and Out of CGDB</h2>

<p><a name="index-invocation-CGDB-1"></a>
This chapter discusses how to start CGDB, and how to get out of it. 
The essentials are:
     </p><ul>
<li>type &#8216;<samp><span class="samp">cgdb</span></samp>&#8217; to start CGDB.

     </li><li>type <kbd>quit</kbd> or <kbd>C-d</kbd> in the GDB window to exit.

     </li><li>type <kbd>:quit</kbd> in the source window to exit.  This even works if GDB is
currently hanging, or operating a long command. 
</li></ul>

<h2 class="chapter">2 Understanding the core concepts of CGDB</h2>

<p><a name="index-understanding-CGDB-2"></a>
<a name="index-status-bar-3"></a><a name="index-CGDB-mode-4"></a><a name="index-GDB-mode-5"></a><a name="index-TTY-mode-6"></a>The CGDB user interface currently consists of two windows and a status bar. 
The source window is currently on the top and the GDB window is on the
bottom.  The <dfn>status bar</dfn> currently separates the two windows.

   </p><p>The interface has several modes depending on which window is focused. 
<dfn>CGDB mode</dfn> is when the source window is focused, <dfn>GDB mode</dfn> is when
the GDB window is focused and <dfn>TTY mode</dfn> is when the TTY window is focused.

   </p><p>Beginning with CGDB version 1.0, the windows are movable,
and the user will be able to create as many or as few that is desired. 
Currently however, all of my time is spent developing the interface between
CGDB and GDB. Once this is complete, the UI of CGDB will become much more
polished.  If you are a ncurses developer, and have spare time to work on this
task, please contact me.

<h3 class="section">2.1 Understanding the source window.</h3>

<p><a name="index-source-window-7"></a>
The <dfn>source window</dfn> is the window that provides you a view of the source
code that the debugged program is made up of.  It will display to the user a
single source file at a time.  While the user is debugging, via <code>next</code>
and <code>step</code>, CGDB will update the source file and line number to keep you
informed as to where GDB is debugging.

   </p><p>CGDB has several features that make debugging easier than using plain old GDB. 
One feature you will notice right away while debugging a C, C++ or ADA program,
is that the source files are syntax highlighted.  This allows the user to
easily navigate through the source file to look for certain places in the
source code.  If you would like to see another source language highlighted,
contact us.  To understanding how to navigate through the source window look
at the commands in <a href="#CGDB-Mode">CGDB Mode</a>.

   </p><p>In addition to showing the source code, CGDB also displays to the user the
currently executing line. The line number will be highlighted green, to
represent that the particular line, is the current line being debugged by GDB. 
Also, CGDB will display an arrow extending from the line number, to the
source line.  You can configure what type of arrow CGDB uses with the
<code>:set arrowstyle</code> configuration option. By default, the <code>short</code>
arrow is used.  However, my personal favorite is the <code>long</code> arrow.

   </p><p>As you navigate through the source window, the current line the cursor is
on will be highlighted white.  This simply helps you keep track of where you
are in the file.

   </p><p>Also, you can set or delete breakpoints in CGDB from the source window.  Simply
navigate to the line that you are interested in setting a breakpoint, and hit
the space bar.  This will set a breakpoint on the line if one did not already
exist.  The line number should turn red to indicate that a breakpoint has
been set.  Hitting the space bar again will delete the breakpoint.  If you
disable the breakpoint, the line number will turn yellow, to represent the
disabled breakpoint.

   </p><p><a name="index-regular-expression-search-8"></a>CGDB also supports regular expression searching within the source window.  If
you type <kbd>/</kbd> or <kbd>?</kbd> you can search in the source window for a string
of interest.  The C library regular expression functions are used to perform
this search, which honors things like &#8216;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&#8217; or &#8216;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&#8217;.

   </p><p>The full list of commands that are available in the source window is in
<a href="#CGDB-Mode">CGDB Mode</a>.

<h3 class="section">2.2 Understanding the GDB window.</h3>

<p><a name="index-GDB-window-9"></a>
<a name="index-GDB-window-10"></a>The <dfn>GDB window</dfn> is how CGDB allows the user to interface with the GNU
debugger.  If you wish to pass a command to GDB, simply type it into this
window and GDB will receive the command.  This interface is intended to be
100% identical to using GDB on a terminal.

   </p><p>There is a limited set of keys that can be typed into this window that CGDB
interprets and handles, instead of sending to GDB.  They are all available in
<a href="#GDB-Mode">GDB Mode</a>.

   </p><p>CGDB attempts to buffer commands the same way they would be if you typed them
at the terminal.  So, if you type several commands before a single one
finishes, they will each be run in order.  There will be no way to stop these
commands from being run besides from typing <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd>, like you would at any
normal terminal when working with GDB.

<h3 class="section">2.3 Understanding the file dialog window.</h3>

<p><a name="index-file-dialog-window-11"></a>
<a name="index-file-dialog-window-12"></a>The <dfn>file dialog window</dfn> is available to help the user view and select
which file they would like to view.  It provides the user with a list of all
the files that make up the program being debugged.  If there are no files
available, because there is no program being debugged or because there is
no debug symbols, then the file dialog will not open and a message will be
displayed at the status bar.

   </p><p>You can get to the file dialog by hitting <code>o</code> when you are at the source
window.  Once you enter the file dialog, it is possible to leave it by hitting
<code>q</code>.  You can navigate the file dialog using the standard direction keys
and you can even use regular expression to find your file.  This can save a
lot of time as the number of files grow.

   </p><p>The full list of commands that are available in the source window is in

<h3 class="section">2.4 Understanding the TTY window.</h3>

<p><a name="index-tty-window-13"></a>
<a name="index-TTY-window-14"></a>The <dfn>TTY window</dfn> is available to allow the user to pass input to the program
being debugged. This window will act similar to the GDB window, except that
the data you type will get sent to the program being debugged. 
See <a href="#Sending-I_002fO-to-Inferior">Sending I/O to Inferior</a>.

   </p><p>You will notice that the TTY window has a terminal device between it and the
program being debugged.  So, if the program being debugged uses say readline,
which allows command line editing, the same interface will be provided via the
TTY window as at the terminal.  You can see the name of the terminal device
in the TTY status bar.

   </p><p>The full list of commands that are available in the source window is in
<a href="#TTY-Mode">TTY Mode</a>.

   </p><p>Sending I/O to the program being debugged can be confusing.  It is described
better in <a href="#Sending-I_002fO-to-Inferior">Sending I/O to Inferior</a>.  Unless the I/O with the program
being debugged is simple, I usually prefer starting the application on a
separate terminal and attaching to it with CGDB.

<h3 class="section">2.5 Understanding the status bar.</h3>

<p><a name="index-status-bar-15"></a>
<a name="index-status-bar-16"></a>The <dfn>status bar</dfn> is the general purpose way for CGDB to show the user
which commands they are currently typing or report errors to the user when
they occur.  CGDB does not use popup's or other forms of I/O to alert the
user of information or problems.

   </p><p>While CGDB is running, you can configure it with any of the commands that
are valid in CGDB's configuration file.  Simply type <kbd>:</kbd> in the source
window, and you will see the colon, and the rest of the command you type
appear in the status bar.  When you are finished typing the command that
you are interested in, type <code>enter</code>.  This will alert CGDB to execute
the command.  If at any point you would like to cancel the current
command typed so far, type the cgdb mode key.  This will put you back
into CGDB mode.  For a description of the cgdb mode key, see
<a href="#Switching-Windows">Switching Windows</a>.

<h3 class="section">2.6 Switch between windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-switch-between-windows-17"></a>
When CGDB is invoked, the interface is in <dfn>GDB mode</dfn>.  A &#8216;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&#8217; at the
right of the status bar indicates that input will be passed to GDB.  To change
the focus to the source window, hit the &lt;ESC&gt; key.  The
<dfn>cgdb mode key</dfn> is the key that is responsible for switching the user
into <dfn>CGDB mode</dfn> from a different mode.  The cgdb mode
key is defaulted to the &lt;ESC&gt; key.  To change this value, look at the
configuration options for CGDB.  See <a href="#Configuring-CGDB">Configuring CGDB</a>.

   </p><p>The interface is now in <dfn>CGDB mode</dfn>.  To switch back into <dfn>GDB mode</dfn>,
press <kbd>i</kbd>.  This syntax is based on the popular Unix text-editor, vi.

<h3 class="section">3.2 Commands available during GDB mode</h3>

<p><a name="index-commands_002c-in-GDB-mode-20"></a>
When in <dfn>GDB mode</dfn>, the user is mostly interested in working with the GDB
console.  That is, sending commands to GDB and receiving data back from GDB. 
Almost all data passed into this window is directly sent to readline and then
to GDB.

   </p><p>It is important to understand that CGDB parses the keys entered in
the GDB window and has the first chance at dealing with them.  If it is
interested in the keys, it will handle them. Below is a list of keys that
CGDB is interested in, and does not pass along any further.

     </p><dl>
<dt><kbd>cgdbmodekey</kbd></dt><dd>Switch back to source window.  This is defaulted to the &lt;ESC&gt; key.

     <br></dd><dt><kbd>page up</kbd></dt><dd>Move up a page.

     <br></dd><dt><kbd>page down</kbd></dt><dd>Move down a page.

     <br></dd><dt><kbd>F11</kbd></dt><dd>Go to the beginning of the GDB buffer.

     <br></dd><dt><kbd>F12</kbd></dt><dd>Go to the end of the GDB buffer. 
</dd></dl>

   <p>Any other keys, besides the ones above, CGDB is currently not interested in. 
CGDB will pass along these keys to the readline library. When readline has
determined that a command has been received, it alerts CGDB, and a command is
then sent to GDB. This is the same method used when invoking GDB directly.

<h3 class="section">3.3 Commands available during the file dialog mode</h3>

<p><a name="index-commands_002c-in-File-Dialog-mode-21"></a>
The file dialog is primarily used to allow the user to find and open a source
file that the program they are debugging is made up of.  The file dialog will
be full screen, and will list each file that the debugged program is made up
of.  A usual instance of the file dialog would be to open it up from the
source window using the <kbd>o</kbd> key, and then to search for the file of
interest. If you are looking for foo.c type <code>/foo.c</code>, press <kbd>enter</kbd>
once to finish the regular expression and again to select the file.

   </p><p>The commands available in the file dialog are:

     </p><dl>
<dt><kbd>q</kbd></dt><dd>Will exit the file dialog, and return to the source window.

     <br></dd><dt><kbd>k</kbd></dt><dt><kbd>up arrow</kbd></dt><dd>Move up a line.

<h2 class="chapter">4 CGDB configuration commands</h2>

<p><a name="index-configuring-CGDB-23"></a>
There may be several features that you find useful in CGDB.  CGDB is capable
of automating any of these commands through the use of the config file called
<samp><span class="file">cgdbrc</span></samp>.  It looks in <samp><span class="env">$HOME</span></samp><samp><span class="file">/.cgdb/</span></samp> for that file.  If it
exists, CGDB executes each line in the file in order.  It is as if the user
typed in all the commands into the status bar after the tui was initialized.

   </p><p>The following variables change the behavior of some aspect of CGDB.  Many
of these commands may be abbreviated in some way, and all boolean commands
my be negated by appending &#8216;<samp><span class="samp">no</span></samp>&#8217; to the front.  For example:
<kbd>:set ignorecase</kbd> turns on case-insensitive searching; while
<kbd>:set noignorecase</kbd> turns on case-sensitive searching.

     </p><dl>
<dt><kbd>:set as=</kbd><var>style</var></dt><dt><kbd>:set arrowstyle=</kbd><var>style</var></dt><dd>Set the arrow style to <var>style</var>.  Possible values for <var>style</var>
are &#8216;<samp><span class="samp">short</span></samp>&#8217;, &#8216;<samp><span class="samp">long</span></samp>&#8217;, and &#8216;<samp><span class="samp">highlight</span></samp>&#8217;.  Changes the style of
the arrow that is used to indicate the currently executing line in the source
viewer.  The default value is short.  A longer arrow is available, for easier
readability.  Finally, the &#8216;<samp><span class="samp">highlight</span></samp>&#8217; option draws no arrow at all,
instead drawing the entire line in inverse video.

     <br></dd><dt><kbd>:set asr</kbd></dt><dt><kbd>:set autosourcereload</kbd></dt><dd>If this is on, CGDB will automatically reload a source file if it has
changed since CGDB has opened it.  If it is off, the file will never be
reloaded, until you start CGDB again. The default is on. 
This feature is useful when you are debugging a program, then you modify
a source file, recompile, and type <kbd>r</kbd> in GDB's CLI window. The file in
this case will be updated to show the new version.  Note, CGDB only looks at
the timestamp of the source file to determine if it has changed. So if
you modify the source file, and didn't recompile yet, CGDB will still
pick up on the changes.

     <br></dd><dt><kbd>:set cgdbmodekey=</kbd><var>key</var></dt><dd>This option is used to determine what key puts CGDB into <dfn>CGDB Mode</dfn>. 
By default, the <kbd>ESC</kbd> key is used.  <var>key</var> can be any normal key
on the keyboard.  It can also be any keycode, as long as the keycode notation
is used.  This option is especially useful when the user wants to use
readline in vi mode.  If the user types <code>set cgdbmodekey=&lt;PageUp&gt;</code>
then the <kbd>Page Up</kbd> key will put CGDB into CGDB mode and the <kbd>ESC</kbd>
key will flow through to readline.

     <br></dd><dt><kbd>:set ic</kbd></dt><dt><kbd>:set ignorecase</kbd></dt><dd>Sets searching case insensitive.  The default is off.

     <br></dd><dt><kbd>:set stc</kbd></dt><dt><kbd>:set showtgdbcommands</kbd></dt><dd>If this is on, CGDB will show all of the commands that it sends to GDB. 
If it is off, CGDB will not show the commands that it gives to GDB. 
The default is off.

     <br></dd><dt><kbd>:set syn=</kbd><var>style</var></dt><dt><kbd>:set syntax=</kbd><var>style</var></dt><dd>Sets the current highlighting mode of the current file to have the syntax
<var>style</var>.  Possible values for <var>syntax</var> are &#8216;<samp><span class="samp">c</span></samp>&#8217;, &#8216;<samp><span class="samp">ada</span></samp>&#8217;, and
&#8216;<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>&#8217;.  Normally, the user will never have to do this, since CGDB
automatically detects what syntax a file should be based on its file
extension.  However, this feature can currently be useful for debugging
purposes.

     <br></dd><dt><kbd>:set to</kbd></dt><dt><kbd>:set timeout</kbd></dt><dd>This option is used along with the <var>ttimeout</var> option to determine the
behavior CGDB should have when it receives part of a mapped key sequence or
a keyboard code sequence.  If this option is on, CGDB will time out on both
user defined mappings and on key codes from the keyboard.  If this option
is off, user defined mappings will not be timed out on.  In this case, CGDB
will determine if it should time out on key codes from the keyboard by
examining the <var>ttimeout</var> option.  To determine how CGDB will time out
on mappings and key codes, and what time out lengths CGDB will use, please
refer to the chart in <a href="#Key-User-Interface">Key User Interface</a>.  The default value for this
option is on.

     <br></dd><dt><kbd>:set tm=</kbd><var>delay</var></dt><dt><kbd>:set timeoutlen=</kbd><var>delay</var></dt><dd>This option is used along with the <var>ttimeoutlen</var> option.  It
represents the number of milliseconds that CGDB should wait for a key code
from the keyboard or for a mapped key sequence to complete.  If <var>delay</var> is
0, CGDB immediately accepts each character it receives.  This will prevent any
mappings or key codes to complete.  <var>delay</var> may be any value between
0 and 10000, inclusive.  The default setting for the <var>delay</var> variable is
1000 (one second).

     <br></dd><dt><kbd>:set ttimeout</kbd></dt><dd>This option is used along with the <var>timeout</var> option to determine the
behavior CGDB should have when it receives part of keyboard code sequence. 
If this option is on, CGDB will time out on key codes from the keyboard.  If
this option is off, CGDB will determine if it should time out on key codes
from the keyboard by examining the <var>timeout</var> option.  To determine how
CGDB will time out on key codes, what what time length it will use, please
refer to the chart in <a href="#Key-User-Interface">Key User Interface</a>.  The default value for this
option is on.

     <br></dd><dt><kbd>:set ttm=</kbd><var>delay</var></dt><dt><kbd>:set ttimeoutlen=</kbd><var>delay</var></dt><dd>This option is used along with the <var>ttimeoutlen</var> option.  It
represents the number of milliseconds that CGDB should wait for a key code
from the keyboard.  If <var>delay</var> is 0, CGDB immediately accepts each character
it receives.  This will prevent any key codes to complete.  <var>delay</var> may
be any value between 0 and 10000, inclusive.  The default setting for the
<var>delay</var> variable is 100 (one tenth of a second).

     <br></dd><dt><kbd>:set ts=</kbd><var>number</var></dt><dt><kbd>:set tabstop=</kbd><var>number</var></dt><dd>Sets the number of spaces that should be rendered on the screen for &lt;TAB&gt;
characters.  The default value for <var>number</var> is 8.

     <br></dd><dt><kbd>:set wmh=</kbd><var>number</var></dt><dt><kbd>:set winminheight=</kbd><var>number</var></dt><dd>The minimal height of a window.  Windows will never become smaller than
this value.  The default value for <var>number</var> is 0.

     <br></dd><dt><kbd>:set winsplit=</kbd><var>style</var></dt><dd>Set the split point between source and GDB window.  This is especially useful
as an init setting in your <samp><span class="file">cgdbrc</span></samp> file.  See <a href="#Configuring-CGDB">Configuring CGDB</a>.  The
possible values for <var>style</var> are &#8216;<samp><span class="samp">top_full</span></samp>&#8217;, &#8216;<samp><span class="samp">top_big</span></samp>&#8217;,

<h2 class="chapter">5 CGDB highlighting groups</h2>

<p><a name="index-highlighting-groups-24"></a>
CGDB is capable of using colors if the terminal it is run in supports them. 
Until version 0.6.1, CGDB did not allow the user to configure these colors in
any way.  CGDB color use is now fully configurable.

   </p><p>CGDB's modeled its use of color highlighting after vim.  Any data that will
be colored in the terminal is represented by a highlighting group. 
A <dfn>highlighting group</dfn> represents data that should be formatted using
foreground colors, background colors and attributes.  There are currently
several types of highlighting groups in CGDB.  There are syntax highlighting
groups, which represent syntax highlighting of sources files.  There are also
User Interface groups, which represent things like CGDB's logo, or the status
bar.

   </p><p>Each highlighting group has a default set of attributes and colors associated
with it.  You can modify a highlighting groups properties by using the
highlight command.  See <a href="#Configuring-CGDB">Configuring CGDB</a>.

   </p><p>Note that CGDB currently supports using the same background color the terminal
was using before CGDB was started.  However, this only works when CGDB was
linked with ncurses.  If you link CGDB with curses, then CGDB will force
the background to Black.

<h3 class="section">5.3 The different colors</h3>

<p><a name="index-colors-27"></a>
CGDB supports several colors, depending on how many colors your terminal
supports.  Below is a chart of the colors that CGDB provides.  The heading
NR-16 is used to represent terminals that support at least 16 colors.  The
heading NR-8 is used to represent terminals that support at least 8 colors. 
The integer values for each color represent the values passed to the curses
function init_pair() to ask curses to create a new color.

<h2 class="chapter">6 CGDB key user interface</h2>

<p><a name="index-CGDB-key-user-interface-28"></a>
The Key User Interface is how CGDB receives input from the user.  It is
usually referred to as the <dfn>KUI</dfn>.  CGDB simply asks the KUI for the next
key the user typed and the KUI will provide it.

   </p><p>The KUI has 2 major responsibilities besides reading normal user input
and providing it to CGDB.  It needs to detect when the user has typed a
user defined map or when the user has hit a special key on the keyboard.

   </p><p>A user defined map, or simply <dfn>map</dfn>, is used to change the meaning
of typed keys.  Some users may refer to this type of functionality as a
<dfn>macro</dfn>.  An example would be <code>map a b</code>.  If the user then typed
the &lt;a&gt; character, the KUI would detect that it was mapped to &lt;b&gt;
and return &lt;b&gt; to CGDB.

   </p><p>When the user types a special key on the keyboard, a <dfn>key code</dfn> is
sent to CGDB.  Typically, keys like  <kbd>HOME</kbd>, <kbd>DEL</kbd>, &lt;F1&gt;, etc,
when pressed will send several characters to the application instead of just
one character like a normal key does.  These characters combined are called a
<dfn>key sequence</dfn>.  The KUI is responsible for assembling the key sequences
back together and reporting to CGDB that a particular key was typed by the
user.  The <kbd>ESC</kbd> key is special because typically most key codes start with
that key.  This usually gives all key codes a common first key in its key
sequence.  The KUI uses the terminfo database to determine what key sequences
are sent by which keycodes.  There are a few commonly used key sequences
that are hard coded into CGDB.

   </p><p>A major challenge the KUI has to overcome is determining when a map or a
key sequence is received.  The KUI sometimes will need to read more than
one character to determine this.  For example, if the user has 2 maps,
<code>map abc def</code> and <code>map abd def</code>, the KUI would have to buffer at
least the characters &lt;a&gt; and &lt;b&gt; before it could determine if the
user was going to type a map.  After the next key press, if the user types
&lt;c&gt; or &lt;d&gt; then a map was received and the KUI will return
<kbd>d e f</kbd> to CGDB.  Otherwise, no map was received and the KUI must return
<kbd>a b</kbd> to CGDB.

   </p><p>The options <var>timeout</var>, <var>ttimeout</var>, <var>timeoutlen</var> and
<var>ttimeoutlen</var> can be used to tell the KUI if it should timeout on
partial mappings or key sequences, and if so, how long it should wait before
timing out.

<h3 class="section">6.1 The KUI's time out options</h3>

<p><a name="index-timeout-29"></a><a name="index-ttimeout-30"></a><a name="index-timeoutlen-31"></a><a name="index-ttimeoutlen-32"></a>
The KUI may be configured to time out on either maps or key sequences.

   </p><p>When the KUI is matching a partial map or key sequence it is capable
of timing out.  This means it will simply accepts the keys it has received so
far if a certain amount of time elapses between key presses.  This is
obvious when the user is typing a map because the user must press each key
individually.  For partial key sequences, this is less obvious.  That is
because the user only presses a single key, but multiple characters are sent
to CGDB.  The table below describes how the user can configure the KUI
to time out on key codes or maps.  The <var>timeout</var> and <var>ttimeout</var>
options control this functionality.

   </p><p><table summary=""><tbody><tr align="left"><th valign="top" width="15%">timeout </th><th valign="top" width="15%">ttimeout </th><th valign="top" width="45%">action
<br></th></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="15%">off
</td><td valign="top" width="15%">off
</td><td valign="top" width="45%">do not time out
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="15%">on
</td><td valign="top" width="15%">on or off
</td><td valign="top" width="45%">time out on maps and key codes
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="15%">off
</td><td valign="top" width="15%">on
</td><td valign="top" width="45%">time out on key codes
   <br></td></tr></tbody></table>

   </p><p>It is also possible to tell the KUI how long to wait before timing out on
a partial match.  If <var>timeout</var> is on, then the KUI will wait a certain
amount of time for the next character, when matching a map, before it
decides a match is no longer possible.  If <var>timeout</var> or
<var>ttimeout</var> is on, then the KUI will wait a certain amount of time for
the next character, when matching a key sequence, before it decides a
match is no longer possible.  The <var>timeoutlen</var> and <var>ttimeoutlen</var>
options can be configured by the user to tell the KUI how long to wait
before timing out.  The table below describes when the KUI uses which
option.

   </p><p><table summary=""><tbody><tr align="left"><th valign="top" width="15%">timeoutlen </th><th valign="top" width="20%">mapping delay </th><th valign="top" width="20%">key code delay
<br></th></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="15%">&lt; 0
</td><td valign="top" width="20%"><var>timeoutlen</var>
</td><td valign="top" width="20%"><var>timeoutlen</var>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="15%">&gt;= 0
</td><td valign="top" width="20%"><var>timeoutlen</var>
</td><td valign="top" width="20%"><var>ttimeoutlen</var>
   <br></td></tr></tbody></table>

   </p><p>A value of 0 means that the KUI will time out right away.  It will not be
possible to match a map or key code in this circumstance.

   </p><p>A common problem could be that when the user types a special key like
the left or right arrows, CGDB will go into the source mode and not
perform the action requested by the user.  This typically means that the
key code delay is to small.  If you try setting the option
<code>set ttimeoutlen=1000</code> CGDB should start acting like the user expects. 
If not, please report this to the CGDB mailing list.

<h3 class="section">6.2 Using maps</h3>

<p>CGDB fully supports the use of maps.  It allows the user to change the
meaning of typed keys. For example, you could have the following map
<code>:map &lt;F2&gt; ip&lt;Space&gt;argc&lt;CR&gt;</code>.

   </p><p>When the user is in CGDB mode and they hit &lt;F2&gt;, the value of the map
will be used instead.  The <kbd>i</kbd> key will first be received by CGDB, and
it will put the user into insert mode.  Next, CGDB will get <kbd>p argc</kbd>
followed by the &lt;Enter&gt; key.

   </p><p>CGDB currently supports two mapping lists.  Any mapping that was added
with the <var>map</var> command will be used by CGDB when it is in CGDB mode. 
You can delete a mapping that you have created with the <var>map</var> command
with the <var>unmap</var> command.  If you want to have mappings in GDB mode, you
can use the <var>imap</var> command.  Similarly, <var>iunmap</var> will delete a
mapping in the <var>imap</var> set.  Some examples of this would be
</p><pre class="example">     map a&lt;Space&gt;b foo
     unmap a&lt;Space&gt;b
     
     imap a&lt;CR&gt;b foo
     iunmap a&lt;CR&gt;b
</pre>

<h3 class="section">6.3 Understanding keycodes</h3>

<p>The above example could use a little more explaining for people unfamiliar
with vim maps.  The map takes a key and a value.  They are separated by
a space.  Neither the key or value can have a space in them, or it is
considered to be the separator between the key and value.  If the user
desires to have a space in either the key or value part of a map, they can
use the keycode notation &lt;Space&gt;.  Below is a table of the
keycodes in <dfn>keycode notation</dfn> form.  The keycode notation can be
used in any mapping command.

<h2 class="chapter">7 Sending I/O to the program being debugged</h2>

<p><a name="index-sending-I_002fO-to-inferior-33"></a>
If the program being debugged takes input on the terminal it is recommended
that the user start the program on one terminal, and attach to it with CGDB
from another terminal.  This is the easiest way to pass input to the
debugged program.

   </p><p>However, if the user wishes to pass input to the program being debugged from
within CGDB, there is a mechanism available for doing so.  As of this writing,
the technique described below does not work on windows, using a natively
compiled GDB.  It may work when using the GDB that comes with Cygwin.

   </p><p>This technique is similar to getting in and out of <dfn>GDB mode</dfn>.  The tty
window is not visible by default.  This is because it is only needed if the
user wishes to send data to the program being debugged.  To display the tty
window, hit <kbd>T</kbd> while in command mode.  After hitting <kbd>T</kbd> you will
notice that there is another window in the middle of the <dfn>source window</dfn>
and the <dfn>gdb window</dfn>.  This is called the <dfn>tty window</dfn>. You will also
see a new status bar called the tty status bar.  There will be a &#8216;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&#8217; on
the tty status bar after the <kbd>T</kbd> was hit.  This is because when the
window is opened with the <kbd>T</kbd> command, CGDB automatically puts the user
into <dfn>TTY mode</dfn>.  To get out of this window hit the cgdb mode key. 
This will put you back into command mode.  To make the tty window appear and
disappear hit the <kbd>T</kbd> key while in command mode.  It is a toggle.

   </p><p>Once the tty window is already open, the user can then hit <kbd>I</kbd> in
command mode to get into <dfn>TTY mode</dfn>.  The user can then hit the
cgdb mode key in the <dfn>TTY mode</dfn> to get back into command mode.

   </p><p>When the tty window is open, all data that comes from the program, goes
there.  Any data typed into the tty window will ONLY go to the program
being debugged.  It will not go to GDB. When the tty window is closed,
all output from the debugged program will go to the <dfn>GDB window</dfn> AND to
the <dfn>tty window</dfn> (for viewing later when the tty window is opened).

   </p><p>If the user wishes to get a new tty for the program being debugged then
they can type <kbd>Ctrl-T</kbd>.  This will delete all the buffered data
waiting to be read into the debugged program. This might be useful when
you rerun or start a new program.

<h2 class="chapter">8 Allowing terminal control flow in CGDB</h2>

<p><a name="index-terminal-control-flow-34"></a>
A user can typically set there control flow behavior by using the stty
command like so <code>stty -ixon -ixoff</code>.  This will disable control flow on
the terminal where CGDB is started.  If you want to turn control flow back
on you can type <code>stty ixon ixoff</code>.  If flow control is on, when the user
types <kbd>Ctrl-s</kbd>, the terminal stops.  When the user types <kbd>Ctrl-q</kbd>, the
terminal restarts.  When using readline, the <kbd>Ctrl-s</kbd> character usually does
a forward search.  So, if you want to get this, or other functionality out of
readline, simply turn off control flow and start CGDB.

<h2 class="chapter">9 Building CGDB from source</h2>

<p><a name="index-building-CGDB-35"></a>
Building CGDB from source requires several packages. First, CGDB is hosted
at http://sf.net/projects/cgdb. You can determine how to get CGDB from source
by looking here: http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=72581.

   </p><p>Once you have the source to CGDB, now you can begin to build it.  You will of
course need many packages to build CGDB. Below is a list of all of them
that are required to build CGDB.

     </p><dl>
<dt><code>GNU Make</code></dt><dd>I have successfully used version 3.79.1, however, older versions probably
will work.

     <br></dd><dt><code>GNU GCC</code></dt><dd>The GNU C compiler. I've compiled CGDB with versions as old as 2.9.5, and as
new as 4.0.2.

     <br></dd><dt><code>GNU Readline</code></dt><dd>The GNU readline library version 5.1. CGDB will not work with versions before
5.1.  Readline was modified specifically to work with CGDB.

     <br></dd><dt><code>GNU Ncurses</code></dt><dd>I have successfully used libncurses.so.5 successfully.  However, older versions
probably will work. 
</dd></dl>

   <p>Below is a list of optional packages you will need, if modifying certain files
in CGDB.

     </p><dl>
<dt><code>GNU Flex</code></dt><dd>If you modify any files with an extension of <code>.l</code>, you will have to have
flex installed.  I have used flex 2.5.4 to build CGDB.

     <br></dd><dt><code>GNU Texinfo</code></dt><dd>If you modify <samp><span class="file">doc/cgdb.texinfo</span></samp>, then you will be required to have this
package installed.  I have used version 4.7 to build the documentation for
CGDB.

     <br></dd><dt><code>help2man</code></dt><dd>If you are doing a release, then you will be required to have this package
installed.  In the <samp><span class="file">doc/</span></samp> build directory, you can execute the command
<code>make cgdb.1</code>, and the CGDB man page will be generated. 
</dd></dl>

   <p>CGDB uses autoconf/automake to build its configure scripts and makefiles.  So,
if you change any of the autoconf/automake files, you will need this software
installed.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
   <h3 class="heading">Preamble</h3>

<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software&#8212;to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   </p><p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   </p><p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. 
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   </p><p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   </p><p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   </p><p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   </p><p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   </p><p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

</p><h3 class="heading">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h3>

     <ol start="0" type="1">
<li>This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The &#8220;Program&#8221;, below,
refers to any such program or work, and a &#8220;work based on the Program&#8221;
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term &#8220;modification&#8221;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &#8220;you&#8221;.

     <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). 
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

     </p></li><li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

     <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

     </p></li><li>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

          <ol start="1" type="a">
<li>You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

          </li><li>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

          </li><li>If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
          </li></ol>

     <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     </p><p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

     </p><p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

     </p></li><li>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

          <ol start="1" type="a">
<li>Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

          </li><li>Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

          </li><li>Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
          </li></ol>

     <p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

     </p><p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

     </p></li><li>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. 
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

     </li><li>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

     </li><li>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

     </li><li>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

     <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

     </p><p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

     </p><p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

     </p></li><li>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

     </li><li>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

     <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &#8220;any
later version&#8221;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

     </p></li><li>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

     <!-- @iftex -->
     <!-- @heading NO WARRANTY -->
     <!-- @end iftex -->
     <!-- @ifinfo -->
     <div align="center">NO WARRANTY</div>
     <!-- @end ifinfo -->
     </li><li>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &#8220;AS IS&#8221; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

     </li><li>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
     </li></ol>

<h3 class="heading">Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

   </p><p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &#8220;copyright&#8221; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

</p><pre class="smallexample">     <var>one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.</var>
     Copyright (C) <var>yyyy</var>  <var>name of author</var>
     
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.
</pre>
   <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

   </p><p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

</p><pre class="smallexample">     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) <var>year</var> <var>name of author</var>
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
</pre>
   <p>The hypothetical commands &#8216;<samp><span class="samp">show w</span></samp>&#8217; and &#8216;<samp><span class="samp">show c</span></samp>&#8217; should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than &#8216;<samp><span class="samp">show w</span></samp>&#8217; and
&#8216;<samp><span class="samp">show c</span></samp>&#8217;; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items&#8212;whatever
suits your program.

   </p><p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &#8220;copyright disclaimer&#8221; for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

</p><pre class="example">     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
     
     <var>signature of Ty Coon</var>, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice
</pre>
   <p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.
